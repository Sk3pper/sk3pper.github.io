# a summary about you
summary: 'Hi! My name is Andrea Bissoli and this is my personal web page where I will post my blog articles, notes and my personal career path. <br> <br> I am passionate about computer science and prone to fully understand how things work by asking myself "<i>why?</i>" and "<i>how?</i>". I like to expand my knowledge both theoretically and through practical activities. I find creative solutions to problems and write code to implement them. My work experience includes:<ul><li><b>Engineering</b>: I gather everything related to engineering, being curious to comprehend the workings of every intricate detail, explore novel solutions, and embrace the creative aspects;</li><li><b>IT</b>: Coding and everything that is related to computer technology.</li> <li><b>Security</b>: In recent years, I developed an interest and competence in cybersecurity, working on information security projects, security by design, writing secure code and training for hardware and software security testing.</li></ul>'
